My weekly journey from learning frontend to becoming a full stack developer.

I'm teaching myself software development. Starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then moving into React and full stack development (Node.js, Express, MongoDB).

## Week 1
- Learned what frontend vs backend developers do
- Set up GitHub and LinkedIn
- Started HTML & CSS basics
